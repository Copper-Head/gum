They say in order to fix anything you need a Russian... and some Gum.


Inspiration
=============

My job as a lab manager involved writing a bunch of scripts that did various things with CSV files. A lot of the code I had to write was boilerplate and I noticed I kept writing the same stuff over and over again. Over winter break I sat down and tried to abstract over all of my scripts and create a set of functions that would make manipulating CSV files a matter of writing one function specific to my task and then running it on a relevant file in just one line.

Since my initial commit I've been revusing this module based on experience working on the UMD Eye-Tracking scripts.

The concept of this module is similar to some *Swiss Army Knife* modules one can find online.


Documentation
==============
Can be found in the *doc/build* folder. Once you've downloaded the code, just open the index.html in a browser.


TODO
====
1. Make this installable like a proper module
